# Terraform Infrastructure Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations written in Terraform to manage AWS resources. Currently, the aws-infra directory holds all configurations related to the deployment and management of AWS resources such as VPCs, subnets, EC2 instances, security groups, and more.

## Use Cases

This repository is designed to demonstrate how to manage and provision AWS infrastructure using Terraform. It's ideal for learning and practicing Terraform best practices, as well as deploying cloud infrastructure in a repeatable and version-controlled way.
